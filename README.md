# arch-asm-project-6

This is the final project for Architecture and Assembly.
I implemented an assembler using something resembling recursive descent. There's backtracking in there somewhere. It's implemented in D, so it can be run by invoking `dub build` and then passing the assembly file as an arguemnt. Otherwise, you can call `dub run -- [input files]`.
